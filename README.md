Hence This model will be trained with a sample data and tested on the remaining data to ensure there would be more accuracy for models.Three supervised machine learning techniques are being used. They were Logistic Regression, Decision tree classifier, Random forest classifier. The model which gives high accuracy is recommended to use.
